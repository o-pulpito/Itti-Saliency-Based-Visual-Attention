Hi everybody,
here you find my own MATLAB implementation of the Itti et al Model of Saliency-Based Visual Attention for Rapid Scene Analysis, proposed in 1998.
It aims at emulating the human visual attention mechanism for extracting points of interest in images by producing the Intensity, Color and Orientation Conspicuity Maps and by fusing them.
I found it very interesting as it involves studies on the Bipolar Cells, Center Surround mechanism, Color Double Opponencies and so on.
I would really appreciate if you could take a look over it and tell me if it looks correct to you.
In particular I could not find any good description of the Winner-Take-All layer so I'm not shure it is exactly the way the author inteded it.
I would like to know how to implement a "leaky integrate-and-fire neuron" model.
Thank you all in advance, enjoy!
